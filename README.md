I spent most of my winter break inside working on programming projects. One in particular monitors the power used by my clothes washer and reports to a remote monitor. The monitor is an M5Core device about 2"x2".1" that has WiFi, a display, some buttons and a speaker in addition to 12 RGB LEDs. When the wash is running it displays the power use and green LED's circle around the device. When the wash is complete, it plays an MP3 file and turns red. Mostly it was a bit of work to remind me when the wash is done. And I had fun!

I spent my winter break on my hobbies inside. I'm into crafting and made some felted Christmas ornaments, Valentine's day themed garlands, earrings and hair accessaries. It was the most relaxing and luxurious time for me to watch YouTube videos and craft especially after running through the bisuest holiday season working as a baker. I also bought a sewing machine, so I'm excited to make aprons, curtains and dresses. 

Recently, I adopted this huge one year old cat who's very shy. I've been busy with trying all sorts appcoaches to warm him up. It is like having a teenager. I hope he will be a little more friendly, but I'll respect his personality if he won't.
