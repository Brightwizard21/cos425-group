I spent most of my winter break inside working on programming projects. One in particular monitors the power used by my clothes washer and reports to a remote monitor. The monitor is an M5Core device about 2"x2".1" that has WiFi, a display, some buttons and a speaker in addition to 12 RGB LEDs. When the wash is running it displays the power use and green LED's circle around the device. When the wash is complete, it plays an MP3 file and turns red. Mostly it was a bit of work to remind me when the wash is done. And I had fun!

My winter break was a mix of hibernation/relaxation and some research. I wrote my first conference
 paper. It looks at tags from the photographs of Flickr users and compares differences in tagging 
 behavior between locals and visitors in Maine. I also pulled photo metadata from the Flickr API for
 2021, which will be used for further research this semester.  On the personal side I relaxed, spent
 time with friends and family, and nerded out with some Minecraft.
