I spent most of my winter break inside working on programming projects. One in particular monitors the power used by my clothes washer and reports to a remote monitor. The monitor is an M5Core device about 2"x2".1" that has WiFi, a display, some buttons and a speaker in addition to 12 RGB LEDs. When the wash is running it displays the power use and green LED's circle around the device. When the wash is complete, it plays an MP3 file and turns red. Mostly it was a bit of work to remind me when the wash is done. And I had fun!

I spent most of my winter break doing very little. I caught a case of covid right before Christmas so I spent most of the holidays inside finding ways to entertain myself. I learned how to sew and made a shirt, did several puzzles, and cooked a wide variety of dishes. When I wasn't sick I went on several hikes and foolishly attempted to make a gym resolution for the new year.
